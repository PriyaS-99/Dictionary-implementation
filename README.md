# Dictionary-implementation
Implementation of Dictionary using C
The implementation involves building a dictionary using simple data structures. It is built in C language using linked lists. It includes adding words to a dictionary, searching a word in the dictionary and displaying words of the dictionary.

The add() function allows a user to add words and their meanings to the dictionary. As the words are added they are automatically arranged in alphabetical order.
The search function searches the dictionary for the specified word and returns it along with its meaning.
The display() function displays the entire dictionary or all the words starting from mentioned alphabet according to user's choice.
